# Trust, Soundness, and Verification in Formal Systems

## Overview

This document examines mechanisms for establishing trust in formal verification systems, including proof checking, soundness guarantees, certification approaches, and abstention with proof for uncertain scenarios. The goal is to understand how to build trustworthy verification systems where both results and explanations can be independently validated.

---

## 1. The Trust Problem in Verification

### 1.1 Verifying the Verifier

**Fundamental Challenge:**
- If the verification tool itself is unproven, results may be unsound
- Bugs in verifier implementations compromise trustworthiness
- How do we trust the tools that establish trust?

**Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?** (Who watches the watchmen?)

**Historical Examples:**

**Pentium FDIV Bug (1994):**
- Intel's floating-point division had hardware error
- Not caught by verification processes
- Cost Intel $475 million
- Lesson: Even extensively tested systems can have bugs

**CompCert Bugs:**
- CompCert is a formally verified C compiler
- Despite verification, bugs found in unverified parts
- Garbage collector, parser, and I/O libraries not verified
- Lesson: Verification only as sound as its scope

---

### 1.2 Approaches to Trust

**Three Main Strategies:**

1. **Verified Verification Tools**
   - Formally verify the verifier itself
   - Reduces trust to proof checker kernel
   - Examples: CompCert, seL4, CakeML

2. **Proof Logging and Independent Checking**
   - Verifier produces checkable proof certificates
   - Small, independently verified checker validates proofs
   - Examples: Z3 proof logs, Isabelle/HOL proof terms

3. **Multiple Independent Tools**
   - Run multiple verifiers, require agreement
   - Different implementations unlikely to have same bugs
   - Examples: SMT-COMP benchmarks, cross-validation

---

## 2. Proof Checking and Certification

### 2.1 Proof Terms in Type Theory

**Curry-Howard Correspondence:**
- Proofs are programs, propositions are types
- Type checking verifies proof correctness
- Small trusted kernel: Type checker

**Architecture:**
```
Large, complex theorem prover
    ‚Üì (generates)
Proof term
    ‚Üì (checked by)
Small, verified type checker ‚Üê Trust only this
    ‚Üì (confirms)
Theorem is valid
```

**Advantages:**
- Trust reduced to small kernel (hundreds/thousands of lines)
- Proof terms provide certificates of correctness
- Independent verification possible
- Type checker amenable to formal verification

**Examples:**

**Coq:**
- Kernel: ~10,000 lines of OCaml
- Tactics: ~500,000 lines (untrusted)
- Trust only kernel + OCaml compiler
- All proofs reduce to kernel verification

**Lean:**
- Small kernel written in Lean itself (bootstrapped)
- Proof terms exported for independent checking
- Community-developed proof checkers (trepplein in Scala)

**Isabelle/HOL:**
- LCF-style architecture: Proofs via trusted inference rules
- Kernel enforces soundness through type system
- Tactics construct proofs but cannot bypass kernel

---

### 2.2 SMT Solver Proof Logs

**Z3 Proof Generation:**
- Produces resolution proofs for SAT core
- Theory-specific sub-proofs (arithmetic, arrays, bit-vectors)
- UNSAT cores identify minimal conflicting constraints

**Proof Format Challenges:**
- Large proofs (gigabytes for complex problems)
- Theory combination makes proofs complex
- No standard format (SMT-LIB2 has proof spec but not universally adopted)

**Independent Checking:**
- Some tools produce independently checkable proofs
- CVC5 proof infrastructure
- Proof reconstruction in Isabelle/HOL from SMT proofs

**Certified Proof Checkers:**

**Recent Work (ArXiv 2405.10611):**
- Formal proof of soundness of neural network verification algorithm
- Proven in Imandra theorem prover
- **Guarantee**: If algorithm returns UNSAT, constraints have no solution
- Provides independent mathematical certainty

**Benefits:**
- Stronger guarantees for safety-critical applications
- Enables wider adoption in interactive theorem proving
- Certification without trusting complex verification tools

---

### 2.3 Verified Compilation and Certified Code

**CompCert: Verified C Compiler**

**Verification Approach:**
- Entire compiler proven correct in Coq
- Specification: Compiled code preserves source semantics
- Proof: Mechanically checked transformation correctness

**Trusted Computing Base:**
- Coq kernel
- OCaml compiler (for extracted Coq code)
- Assembler and linker
- Hardware

**Results:**
- Guarantees: If compilation succeeds, binary preserves C semantics
- Bugs found only in unverified components (parser, I/O)
- Used in aerospace, automotive safety-critical systems

**Lessons:**
- Full verification feasible for non-trivial systems
- Unverified components remain vulnerability
- Performance competitive with optimization levels -O1/-O2

---

**seL4: Verified Operating System Kernel**

**Verification:**
- Microkernel proven to satisfy high-level specification
- Proof in Isabelle/HOL: ~200,000 lines
- Implementation: ~10,000 lines C, ~500 lines assembly

**Properties Verified:**
- Functional correctness (implements specification)
- Integrity (isolation between processes)
- Confidentiality (information flow)

**Trusted Computing Base:**
- Hardware (including CPU, caches, memory)
- Assembly code (~500 lines)
- Compiler correctness (or use CompCert)
- Isabelle/HOL kernel

**Results:**
- Highest security certification (Common Criteria EAL7)
- No vulnerabilities found in verified components
- Practical performance for embedded systems

**Applications:**
- Military systems (secure communication)
- Medical devices (insulin pumps with security)
- Automotive (DARPA HACMS program)
- Aerospace (autonomous drones)

---

### 2.4 Proof-Carrying Code

**Architecture:**
- Code ships with machine-checkable proof of safety properties
- Receiver's small proof checker verifies proof
- No need to trust code producer, only checker

**Applications:**
- Mobile code (applets, plugins)
- Software updates with security guarantees
- Kernel modules that cannot compromise system

**Challenges:**
- Generating proofs automatically difficult
- Proofs can be large
- Specification of safety properties complex

**Modern Variants:**
- Typed assembly language (TAL)
- Certified binaries with Coq extraction
- WebAssembly with formal semantics

---

## 3. Soundness in Program Analysis

### 3.1 Defining Soundness

**Sound Analysis:**
- Reports all possible behaviors (no false negatives)
- May report behaviors that don't actually occur (false positives)
- **Guarantee**: If analysis says property holds, it definitely holds

**Complete Analysis:**
- Reports only actual behaviors (no false positives)
- May miss some actual behaviors (false negatives)
- **Guarantee**: If analysis reports behavior, it actually occurs

**Tradeoff:**
- Soundness preferred for verification (safety-critical)
- Completeness preferred for bug-finding (developer tools)
- Both impossible for Turing-complete languages (Rice's Theorem)

---

### 3.2 Soundness Bugs in Verifiers

**Common Sources:**

1. **Incorrect Axiomatization**
   - Formal model doesn't match actual semantics
   - Example: Floating-point arithmetic without NaN/infinity handling

2. **Implementation Bugs**
   - Theory solver has errors
   - Conflict resolution incorrect
   - Propagation bugs

3. **Unverified Components**
   - Parser may misinterpret input
   - Pretty-printer may misrepresent results
   - I/O libraries corrupt data

4. **Theory Combination**
   - Nelson-Oppen combination requires convexity
   - Not all theory combinations sound

**Detection:**
- Differential testing (multiple solvers)
- Proof logging and checking
- Fuzzing with property checking
- Formal verification of verifier

---

### 3.3 Machine-Checked Soundness Proofs

**Approach:**
- Formalize verification algorithm in proof assistant
- Prove soundness theorem mechanically
- Extract verified implementation

**Examples:**

**Verified VCGen (Verification Condition Generator):**
- Formalized in Coq
- Proved: Generated VCs imply program correctness
- Extracted to executable OCaml code
- **Guarantee**: If VCs verified, program correct

**Verified Abstract Interpreters:**
- Formalized abstract domains and transfer functions
- Proved soundness: Abstract results over-approximate concrete
- Used for static analysis with guarantees

**Benefits:**
- Soundness proof mechanically checked
- Implementation guaranteed sound (via extraction)
- Trust reduced to proof assistant kernel

**Costs:**
- Significant development effort
- Performance may lag hand-optimized implementations
- Maintenance burden

---

## 4. Abstention with Proof: Knowing What You Don't Know

### 4.1 The Abstention Paradigm

**Definition:**
- Explicit refusal to answer when certainty insufficient
- Includes expressing uncertainty, conflicting conclusions, refusal due to harm
- **With proof**: Provide certificate explaining *why* answer unknown

**Contrast with Traditional Approaches:**
- **Guessing**: Return best-effort answer (may be wrong)
- **Silent failure**: Return nothing (user doesn't know why)
- **Abstention with proof**: Return certificate of uncertainty (user knows bounds)

---

### 4.2 Abstention in Safety-Critical Systems

**Three Mile Island Example (from temporal verification paper):**

**Traditional System:**
- Pressure indicator shows valve closed
- Flow measurements inconsistent with closed valve
- Operators must choose which to trust
- 2 hours 20 minutes to identify stuck valve

**Abstention with Proof:**
- System detects contradiction
- Provides certificate: "Indicator and flow measurements inconsistent"
- Proof identifies specific contradiction
- Mandatory manual verification triggered immediately

**Benefits:**
- Uncertainty made explicit
- Human intervention required (not optional)
- Contradiction proven, not inferred
- Response time drastically reduced

---

**Medtronic Insulin Pump Example:**

**Traditional System:**
- Battery prediction becomes unreliable after impact
- System continues operating with unreliable predictions
- Patients experience hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis

**Abstention with Proof:**
- System detects battery monitoring inconsistency
- Certificate: "Battery time cannot be verified to required confidence"
- Immediate patient notification mandatory
- Backup insulin supply protocol triggered

**Benefits:**
- Silent failure prevented
- Uncertainty bounds explicit
- Patient safety prioritized over continuous operation

---

### 4.3 Abstention in Formal Verification

**Scenarios Requiring Abstention:**

1. **Solver Timeout**
   - Traditional: Return "unknown" (no information)
   - With proof: Certificate of search space explored, bounds on remaining

2. **Quantifier Instantiation**
   - Traditional: Heuristic E-matching (may miss instantiations)
   - With proof: Certificate of instantiation strategy, completeness bounds

3. **Floating-Point Arithmetic**
   - Traditional: Over-approximate (sound but imprecise)
   - With proof: Certificate of uncertainty bounds, rounding error ranges

4. **Incomplete Theory**
   - Traditional: Fail verification (conservative)
   - With proof: Certificate identifying incomplete axioms, suggest strengthening

---

### 4.4 Uncertainty Quantification in LLM-Driven Formal Methods

**Recent Research (ArXiv 2505.20047):**

**Problem:**
- LLMs generate formal specifications from natural language
- Formalization errors propagate through sound solvers
- Result: Formally verified but wrong specification

**Solution: Uncertainty-Based Selective Verification**
- Lightweight fusion of uncertainty signals
- Abstention when uncertainty exceeds threshold
- Drastically reduces errors (14-100%) with minimal abstention

**Uncertainty Signals:**
- LLM confidence scores
- Multiple sample agreement
- Consistency checks (parse and regenerate)
- Formal property violations

**Benefits:**
- Prevents upstream formalization errors
- Uncertainty quantification for LLM-generated artifacts
- Transforms LLM-driven formalization into reliable engineering

**Applications:**
- Automated theorem proving with LLM assistants
- Program synthesis from natural language
- Formal specification generation

---

### 4.5 Conformal Prediction and Principled Abstention

**Safety-Critical Perception (ArXiv, IEEE):**

**Conformal Prediction:**
- Provides statistically guaranteed uncertainty estimates
- Prediction sets with coverage guarantees
- Example: "Object is car or truck with 95% confidence"

**Principled Abstention:**
- Conformal threshold for valid prediction sets
- Abstention threshold optimized via ROC analysis
- High-risk scenarios trigger selective prediction

**Architecture:**
```
Sensor data ‚Üí ML model ‚Üí Conformal prediction
                              ‚Üì
                    Uncertainty < threshold?
                         ‚Üô            ‚Üò
                      Yes             No
                       ‚Üì               ‚Üì
                 Use prediction    Abstain + Certificate
                                        ‚Üì
                              Fallback protocol
```

**Applications:**
- Autonomous vehicles (safety-critical perception)
- Medical diagnosis (uncertain cases flagged)
- Industrial robotics (safe operation boundaries)

---

### 4.6 Abstention with Certificates in Temporal Reasoning

**Google Spanner TrueTime:**

**Traditional Distributed Systems:**
- Assume clock synchronization within bounds
- Violations silent (discovered during audits)
- Temporal ordering may be incorrect

**TrueTime with Abstention:**
- Clock uncertainty exposed as interval [earliest, latest]
- Typically 1-7ms across datacenters
- **Commit wait**: Delays commits until uncertainty resolves

**Certificate:**
- TT.now() returns interval, not point
- Guarantee: Actual time definitely in interval
- If interval too large, operations deferred (explicit abstention)

**Benefits:**
- External consistency guaranteed
- Temporal violations impossible by construction
- Uncertainty bounds explicit and proven

**Applications:**
- Gmail (globally consistent state)
- Google Photos (consistent album ordering)
- Advertising infrastructure (billing consistency)

---

## 5. Regulatory and Certification Frameworks

### 5.1 DO-178C: Aerospace Software Certification

**Requirements:**
- "Multiple iterations of code to ensure correct characteristics of time-related functions"

---

## 7. Soundness vs. Completeness Tradeoffs

### 7.1 Verification Goals

- Example: No buffer overflows (prove absence)

**Liveness Properties ("Good things eventually happen"):**
- Require completeness (no false positives)
- False negatives acceptable (may miss some progress proofs)
- Example: Every request eventually serviced

**Precision Goals:**
- Minimize false positives (reduce developer burden)
- Balance soundness with usability
- Abstraction refinement techniques

---

### 7.2 Incomplete Theories

**Quantified Formulas:**
- SMT solvers use heuristic instantiation
- Not complete for all quantifier patterns
- May report "unknown" even for provable formulas

**Non-Linear Arithmetic:**

- Undecidable for integers
- SMT solvers incomplete, use approximations

**Abstention Strategy:**
- When incompleteness hit, provide certificate
- Certificate: Quantifier instantiation strategy exhausted, bound on remaining space
- User can strengthen specification or provide hints

---

### 7.3 Timeouts and Resource Bounds

**Traditional Approach:**
- Return "unknown" after timeout
- No information about progress

**With Certificates:**
- Return search space explored
- Bounds on remaining search
- Suggestions for decomposition or simplification

**Example:**
```
Certificate after timeout:
- Explored 10^6 of estimated 10^9 states
- Bottleneck: Quantifier instantiation on predicate P
- Suggestion: Strengthen invariant or add triggers for P
```

**Benefits:**
- User understands why verification failed

## 11. Conclusion: Toward Trustworthy Formal Verification

Building trust in formal verification systems requires multiple complementary approaches:

1. **Proof Certification**: Small trusted kernels, independently checkable proofs
2. **Soundness Guarantees**: Machine-checked soundness proofs, verified verifiers
3. **Abstention with Proof**: Explicit uncertainty with certificates, no silent failures
4. **Transparency**: Explainable results, provenance tracking, visual exploration
5. **Regulatory Alignment**: Standards compliance, certified tools, auditable evidence

The key insight: **Trust emerges not from complexity but from simplicity and verifiability.** Small trusted kernels, mathematical proofs of soundness, and explicit abstention with certificates provide stronger guarantees than large untrusted tools claiming certainty.

For safety-critical applications (aerospace, medical, financial, autonomous systems), the cost of verification is justified by the cost of failures. Historical disasters (Three Mile Island, Therac-25, Knight Capital, Boeing 737 MAX) demonstrate that unverified systems fail catastrophically. Formal verification with trustworthy tools and abstention for uncertainty provides the path toward systems we can rely on when lives and billions of dollars are at stake.

The future of trustworthy AI requires these same principles: verified reasoning, certified explanations, explicit abstention for uncertainty, and mathematical proofs of correctness. Logic programming with provenance, neuro-symbolic architectures with uncertainty quantification, and proof-carrying code represent convergent approaches toward this vision. The research synthesized here provides foundations for building systems that are not just powerful, but trustworthy.
