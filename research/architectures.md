## Overview

This document identifies and categorizes architectural patterns in neuro-symbolic AI systems based on recent research (2023-2025), focusing on how neural and symbolic components interact.

---

## 1. Architecture Taxonomy

### A. Pipeline Architectures

**Definition**: Sequential flow where neural and symbolic components operate in distinct stages with limited or no bidirectional feedback.

#### Type A1: Neural ‚Üí Symbolic (One-way)

**Pattern**: LLM translates natural language to symbolic formulation, then symbolic solver executes

**Examples**:
