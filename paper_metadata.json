  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable semantic understanding but exhibit catastrophic failures in formal reasoning, with temporal duration calculation accuracy of only 13-16% and nested quantifier reasoning success rates of 20-40%. These fundamental limitations prevent deployment in safety-critical domains requiring regulatory compliance (DO-178C aerospace, FDA medical devices, SEC Rule 613 financial systems, GDPR Article 22 automated decision-making). We present a unified neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLM semantic parsing with logic programming domain-specific languages (Prolog, ASP, Datalog), provenance-based explanation via semiring semantics, and formal verification to provide mathematically guaranteed explanations with temporal correctness proofs. Our system employs a multi-DSL fine-tuned LLM (Llama 3.1 8B with QLoRA) achieving 82% Pass@1 across multiple formal languages—only 2 percentage points below specialized single-DSL models while requiring one unified model instead of five. For temporal reasoning, we introduce a hybrid architecture combining LLM temporal extraction with Allen's Interval Algebra and Simple Temporal Network solvers, demonstrating 120-160% improvement over pure LLM approaches on a comprehensive 5,000-problem benchmark spanning five difficulty levels. Our provenance-guided DSL generation leverages why/why-not provenance polynomials for constraint synthesis, achieving 84% Pass@1 compared to 68% for baseline LLMs. A user study with 45 domain experts validates that provenance-based explanations achieve 95% faithfulness versus 68% for LLM post-hoc explanations, with 40% faster debugging time and superior trust calibration (Pearson r=0.78 vs r=0.52). For safety-critical deployment, we introduce uncertainty-aware selective verification that reduces false negative rates from 18% to 1-3% through lightweight fusion of confidence signals, achieving 87% automation rate with <1% error using a two-tier abstention strategy. Case studies in healthcare (sepsis protocol verification), finance (SEC Rule 613 timestamp compliance), and legal (contract deadline analysis with GDPR compliance) demonstrate practical deployment meeting regulatory requirements. This framework advances neuro-symbolic AI from research prototypes to production systems with provably faithful explanations and formal temporal guarantees.",
