# DSL Taxonomy for Formal Verification and LLM Integration

## Executive Summary

This taxonomy categorizes formal verification domain-specific languages (DSLs) across seven major categories, analyzing their expressiveness, learnability, and LLM-friendliness based on research from 2020-2025 and examination of production systems. The analysis reveals that **logic programming approaches (Prolog, ASP) offer fundamentally superior explainability** compared to SMT-based verification while achieving competitive or superior performance on many reasoning tasks, with neuro-symbolic systems combining LLMs with logic programming outperforming pure neural approaches by 40-160% on reasoning benchmarks.

## Category 1: Logic Programming DSLs

### 1.1 Prolog

**Expressiveness:**
- First-order logic with full quantification through variables
- Native recursion and backtracking search
- Natural compound terms and unification
- Meta-programming capabilities via predicates as data
- Definite Clause Grammars for parsing/NLP

**Learnability:**
- **High initial barrier**: Declarative paradigm shift from imperative thinking
- Requires understanding unification, backtracking, and cut operators
- Pattern matching relatively intuitive once paradigm understood
- SWI-Prolog documentation and community support strong

**LLM-Friendliness (74% Pass@1 for GPT-4o):**
- LLM-extracted predicates + external Prolog interpreters outperform Chain-of-Thought
- Predicate permutation as data augmentation (leverages ordering-insensitivity)
- DeepSeek-V3: 80% accuracy on financial reasoning (vs 63-76% pure CoT)
- Deterministic, explainable reasoning with explicit logical predicates
- **Pattern**: LLMs should extract predicates; interpreters handle execution

**Key Characteristics:**
```prolog
% Declarative rule definition
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).

% Recursive definition
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
```

**Production Systems:**
- ECLiPSe: Used at Cisco, Opel/Flexis (VDA Logistics Award 2015)
- SWI-Prolog: 500+ universities, extensive library ecosystem
- SICStus Prolog: Fastest finite domain constraint solver

**Tradeoffs:**
- ✓ Natural expression of rules and facts
- ✓ Execution traces show reasoning steps (SLD resolution trees)
- ✗ Arithmetic constraints inefficient without CLP extensions
- ✗ Depth-first search can be inefficient without optimization
- ✗ "Obvious" identities (x+y=y+x) difficult to deduce natively

### 1.2 Answer Set Programming (ASP)

**Expressiveness:**
- Non-monotonic reasoning with stable model semantics
- No quantifiers (grounding + SAT solving approach)
- Choice rules, aggregates (#sum, #min, #count)

- Clingo/Gringo toolchain well-documented

**LLM-Friendliness:**
- LLASP fine-tuning: **Specialized training >> general-purpose scale**
- Lightweight fine-tuned model dramatically outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs
- GPT-3/GPT-4: Transform logic puzzles to ASP with few-shot examples (but errors common)

- **Key insight**: LLMs excel at NL→ASP translation; symbolic solvers essential for reasoning

**Key Characteristics:**
```asp
% Choice rule: bird(tweety) or not bird(tweety)
{ bird(tweety) }.

% Constraint: cannot be both
:- bird(X), not flies(X), not penguin(X).

% Weak constraint (optimization)
:~ bird(X). [1@1, X]

% Aggregates
total_birds(N) :- N = #count{X : bird(X)}.
```

**Unique Properties:**
- **Non-hallucination guarantee**: Everything in answer set has justification

**Key Characteristics:**
```datalog
path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Y).
path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Z), path(Z, Y).

% Stratified negation allowed
not_connected(X, Y) :- node(X), node(Y), !path(X, Y).
```

4. **Explainable**: Design for explanation generation (provenance, justification trees)
5. **Formally verifiable**: Separate LLM generation from symbolic verification

### For Choosing Existing DSLs:

**Use Logic Programming (Prolog/ASP) when:**
- Human explanations required

2. **Provenance-Aware Architectures**: Track derivations through NL→DSL→solving→explanation pipeline
3. **Temporal Reasoning Integration**: Hybrid LLM extraction + Allen's algebra + STN/STNU solvers
4. **Interactive Explanation Refinement**: Learn optimal explanations from user feedback
5. **Certified Explanation Generation**: Formal verification that explanations are faithful
