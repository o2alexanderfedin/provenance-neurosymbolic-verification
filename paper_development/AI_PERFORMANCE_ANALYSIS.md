## Appendix B: Productivity Formulas

### B.1 Speedup Calculation

```
Speedup = Human Time (hours) / AI Time (hours)

Example (Paper Writing):
Human Time: 106-212 hours (11,366 words ÷ 500-1,000 words/day)
AI Time: 0.25 hours (15 minutes)
Speedup: 106÷0.25 = 424x to 212÷0.25 = 848x
```

### B.2 Cost Efficiency

```
Cost Savings = (Human Cost - AI Cost) / Human Cost × 100%

Example (Full Project):
Human Cost: $31,400-$65,800 (@$100/hour)
AI Cost: $4,005-$8,010 (AI + validation)
Savings: ($31,400 - $4,005) / $31,400 = 87.2%
        to ($65,800 - $8,010) / $65,800 = 87.8%
```

### B.3 Quality-Adjusted Productivity

```
QAP = (Output Quantity × Output Quality) / (Input Time + Correction Time)

Where Quality is on 0-1 scale (A=0.95, A-=0.93, B+=0.88, etc.)

Example (This Project):
Output: 31,329 lines × 0.93 quality = 29,136 quality-adjusted lines
Time: 76 minutes wall-clock + 10 minutes corrections = 86 minutes
QAP: 29,136 / 86 = 339 quality-adjusted lines per minute

Human Equivalent:
Output: 31,329 lines × 0.95 quality = 29,763 quality-adjusted lines
Time: 380 hours average = 22,800 minutes
QAP: 29,763 / 22,800 = 1.3 quality-adjusted lines per minute

Productivity Multiple: 339 / 1.3 = 261x
```

### B.4 ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment × 100%

Example (AI-Assisted vs Pure Human):
Pure Human Cost: $50,000 average
AI-Assisted Cost: $6,000 average (AI + validation)
Time Saved: 450 hours average
Value of Time: 450 × $100 = $45,000

Gain: $45,000 (time saved) - $10 (AI cost) = $44,990
ROI: $44,990 / $6,000 = 750% return on investment
```
