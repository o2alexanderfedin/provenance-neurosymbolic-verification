# Quick Start Guide: Provenance-Guided Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Research

**For researchers, practitioners, and industry partners looking to quickly understand and use this research.**

---

## 5-Minute Overview

**What is this?**
A comprehensive academic research project showing how to combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with formal verification systems through executable logic programming languages.

**Why does it matter?**
Pure LLMs fail catastrophically on certain reasoning tasks (e.g., 14% accuracy on temporal duration calculations), while hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches achieve 40-529% improvements with verified explanations.

**Who is this for?**
- Academic researchers in AI, formal methods, neuro-symbolic systems
- Practitioners deploying AI in safety-critical domains (healthcare, finance, aerospace, legal)
- Industry partners seeking regulatory-compliant AI solutions

```

### Example Output

```
=== Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoner ===

Input: "Patient admitted Monday, underwent surgery Tuesday, discharged Friday. Hospital stay duration?"

[Step 1] LLM Extraction...
  ‚úì Extracted 3 events: admission, surgery, discharge
  ‚úì Identified 2 temporal relations:
    - admission BEFORE surgery (confidence: 0.95)
    - surgery BEFORE discharge (confidence: 0.92)

[Step 2] Symbolic Reasoning...
  ‚úì Converted to Allen's Interval Algebra
  ‚úì Path consistency check: PASSED
  ‚úì Duration calculation: 4 days (Monday to Friday inclusive)

[Step 3] Verification...
  ‚úì LLM-Symbolic agreement: YES
  ‚úì Consistency check: PASSED
  ‚úì Overall confidence: 1.00

Answer: "4 days"

Provenance (7 steps):
  1. LLM extracted event: admission(Monday) [confidence: 0.98]
  2. LLM extracted event: surgery(Tuesday) [confidence: 0.97]
  3. LLM extracted event: discharge(Friday) [confidence: 0.96]
  4. LLM inferred: admission BEFORE surgery [confidence: 0.95]
  5. Symbolic verified: admission.end ‚â§ surgery.start [constraint: SATISFIED]
  6. Symbolic calculated: duration = 4 days [arithmetic: EXACT]
  7. Hybrid consensus: VERIFIED [agreement: 100%]

Explanation: "The patient was admitted on Monday and discharged on Friday,
resulting in a 4-day hospital stay. This calculation is verified using
Allen's Interval Algebra to ensure temporal consistency."
```

## Understanding the Research Structure

### Three-Layer Architecture

```
Layer 1: LLM Semantic Parser
  ‚Üì (Natural language ‚Üí Formal specification)
Layer 2: Symbolic Reasoning Engine
  ‚Üì (Deterministic computation with proofs)
Layer 3: Provenance Tracking
  ‚Üì (Explanation generation)
Output: Verified Answer + Certified Explanation
```

**Why this matters:**
- LLMs excel at understanding natural language, fail at arithmetic
- Symbolic systems excel at computation, fail at natural language
- Provenance provides mathematical guarantee of explanation faithfulness

### Key Innovation: Three-Way Integration

1. **Provenance ‚Üí LLM:** Use why-not-provenance to guide refinement
2. **LLM ‚Üí Symbolic:** Parse natural language to formal DSL
3. **Symbolic ‚Üí Provenance:** Track all reasoning steps algebraically

**Result:** System that is powerful (LLM), accurate (symbolic), and explainable (provenance)

## Common Questions

### Q: Why not just use a bigger LLM?

**A:** Our research shows all LLMs (16B-175B+) exhibit all error categories, suggesting architectural limitations rather than scale issues. Even GPT-4o achieves only 14% on temporal duration calculations.

### Q: Why logic programming instead of SMT?

**A:** Trade-off depends on use case:
- **SMT:** Highest performance (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ), poorest explanation (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ) ‚Üí Use for large-scale verification
- **Logic Programming:** Excellent explanation (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ), moderate performance (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ) ‚Üí Use for explainable AI
- **Hybrid:** Use both! LLM + Prolog/ASP for explainability + SMT for theories

### Q: What if I need real-time performance?

**A:** Current prototype is <10ms per query. For higher loads:
- Distributed constraint solving (1000s of events)
- GPU-accelerated STN solving
- Incremental verification for streaming data
- See paper Discussion Section 7.3 for optimization strategies

### Q: How do I get fine-tuned models?

**A:** Two options:
1. **Use existing:** LLASP (ASP), ConstraintLLM (MiniZinc), GPT-4o with specialized prompting
2. **Fine-tune your own:** Follow `experimental_design.md` Section 2 (multi-DSL curriculum learning)
   - Estimated cost: $2-5K for 5,000 training examples
   - Hardware: 3√ó RTX A6000 GPUs (QLoRA)
   - Time: 2-3 weeks

### Q: Is this ready for production?

**A:** Current status:
- ‚úÖ Prototype demonstrates feasibility
- ‚úÖ Experimental design is complete
- ‚è≥ Full experimental validation planned (24 weeks)

**For production deployment:**
1. Start with low-risk domain (not safety-critical)
2. Use high uncertainty threshold (Œ∏=0.85+) initially
3. Implement human-in-the-loop for abstention cases
4. Gradually increase automation as confidence grows

### Q: How do I contribute?

**A:** Several opportunities:
1. **Benchmark contributions:** Add problems to 5-level temporal benchmark
2. **DSL integration:** Add support for additional formal languages (CLP, CHR, Lean, etc.)
3. **Domain expertise:** Participate in user study (healthcare, finance, legal experts needed)
4. **Open source:** Improve prototype (optimization, visualization, tooling)
