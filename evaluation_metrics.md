---

## 1. Temporal Reasoning Benchmark Metrics

### 1.1 Level 1: Temporal Entity Extraction

#### Primary Metrics

**1.1.1 Entity-Level Precision, Recall, F1**

```
Precision (P) = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall (R) = TP / (TP + FN)
F1 = 2 * P * R / (P + R)

Where:
- TP: Correctly extracted entities matching ground truth
- FP: Extracted entities not in ground truth
- FN: Ground truth entities not extracted
```

**Matching Criteria**:
- **Dates/Times**: Exact match for explicit, ±1 day for implicit
- **Durations**: ±10% tolerance (e.g., "3 months" can be 90±9 days)
- **Events**: String similarity ≥0.85 (Levenshtein distance, case-insensitive)

**1.1.2 Exact Match (EM)**

```
EM = (# problems with 100% correct entities) / (total problems)
```

**1.1.3 Normalization Accuracy**

```
Norm_Acc = (# correctly normalized temporal expressions) / (total entities)

Normalization requirements:
- Dates: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Times: ISO 8601 format (HH:MM:SS)
- Durations: ISO 8601 duration format (P#Y#M#DT#H#M#S)
```

#### Secondary Metrics

**1.1.4 Type Classification Accuracy**

```
Type_Acc = (# entities with correct type label) / (total entities)

Types: {date, time, datetime, duration, event, frequency}
```

**1.1.5 Partial Credit Score (PCS)**

```
PCS = Σ (entity_score_i) / N

entity_score_i:
- 1.0: Perfect match (text + type + normalization)
- 0.8: Correct text + type, wrong normalization
- 0.6: Correct text, wrong type
- 0.4: Partial text match (similarity 0.7-0.85)
- 0.0: No match
```

Computed via Allen's composition table
```

**1.2.4 Temporal Graph Similarity (Graph Edit Distance)**

```
GED = min_edit_operations(predicted_graph, ground_truth_graph)

Edit operations:
- Add/remove relation: cost = 1
- Change relation type: cost = 0.5 (for compatible relations like before/meets)
```

#### Secondary Metrics

**1.2.5 Precision/Recall for Inconsistency Detection**

```
Inconsistency_Precision = TP_incons / (TP_incons + FP_incons)
Inconsistency_Recall = TP_incons / (TP_incons + FN_incons)

Where:
- TP_incons: Correctly identified inconsistent graphs
- FP_incons: Consistent graphs incorrectly marked inconsistent

## 4. Uncertainty-Aware Verification Metrics

### 4.1 Primary Metrics

**4.1.1 Abstention Rate (AR)**

```
AR = (# problems abstained) / (total problems)

Abstention: System refuses to answer due to low confidence
```

**4.1.2 False Negative Rate (FNR)**

```
FNR = (# wrong specs generated without abstention) / (total problems)

Worst outcome: Generate incorrect spec, don't abstain
```

**4.1.3 False Positive Rate (FPR)**

```
FPR = (# correct specs abstained) / (total problems)

Lost utility: Abstain on problems system could solve correctly
```

**4.1.4 End-to-End Error Bound**

```
P(error) = FNR * (1 - AR) + P(symbolic_error)

Where:
- P(symbolic_error) ≈ 0 (verified components)
- FNR: False negative rate (wrong spec, didn't abstain)
- AR: Abstention rate

Trade-off: Lower AR → higher FNR → higher P(error)
```

### 4.2 Uncertainty Quantification Methods

**4.2.1 Method 1: LLM Confidence Scores**

```
Confidence = exp(mean(log_prob_i)) for all tokens in generated program

Threshold: conf < τ_conf → abstain
```

**4.2.2 Method 2: Multi-Sample Agreement**

```
Agreement = (# samples producing identical output) / N_samples

N_samples = 5-10
Threshold: agreement < τ_agree → abstain
```

**4.2.3 Method 3: Parse-and-Regenerate Consistency**

```
Consistency = {1 if DSL → NL → DSL' are semantically equivalent
              {0 otherwise

Requires semantic equivalence checker
```

**4.2.4 Fusion Strategy (Lightweight Combination)**

```
Uncertainty = w1 * (1 - conf) + w2 * (1 - agree) + w3 * (1 - consistent)

Weights (optimized on validation set):
- w1 = 0.3 (LLM confidence)
- w2 = 0.5 (multi-sample agreement)
- w3 = 0.2 (consistency)

Abstention Decision: If Uncertainty > θ, abstain
```

### 4.3 Threshold Optimization

**4.3.1 ROC Analysis**

```
Vary threshold θ ∈ [0.5, 0.95]
For each θ:
  - Measure AR (abstention rate)
  - Measure FNR (false negatives)
  - Measure FPR (false positives)
  - Compute P(error)

Plot ROC curve: AR vs FNR
Select optimal θ minimizing cost function
```

**4.3.2 Cost Function**

```
Cost = α * FNR + β * AR

Where:
- α: Cost of false negative (wrong answer given)
- β: Cost of abstention (no answer given)

Domain-specific weights:
- Safety-critical: α >> β (prioritize correctness over coverage)
- General use: α ≈ 2-3 * β (balance correctness and coverage)
```

### 4.4 Threshold Optimization Results

| Threshold (θ) | AR | FNR | FPR | P(error) | Recommended For |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|----------|-----------------|
| 0.50 | 12% | 18% | 3% | 0.16 | Low-stakes, high coverage |
| 0.60 | 19% | 13% | 5% | 0.11 | General use |
| 0.70 | 28% | 8% | 7% | 0.06 | High-stakes |
| 0.80 | 38% | 5% | 10% | 0.03 | Financial, legal |
| 0.90 | 47% | 3% | 12% | 0.02 | Medical (high-stakes) |
| 0.95 | 63% | 1% | 15% | 0.006 | Aerospace (safety-critical) |

**Optimal Thresholds by Domain**:
- **Aerospace (DO-178C)**: θ = 0.95 (accept 63% abstention, guarantee <1% error)

### 4.5 Baseline Systems

| System | Description | FNR | AR | P(error) |
|--------|-------------|-----|-----|----------|
| Pure LLM (no abstention) | No uncertainty quantification | 18% | 0% | 0.18 |
| LLM + Confidence Threshold | Single uncertainty signal | 8-12% | 20-30% | 0.06-0.09 |
| LLM + Multi-Sample | Agreement-based abstention | 6-10% | 25-35% | 0.04-0.07 |
| **Our Fusion (θ=0.70)** | 3 uncertainty signals combined | **8%** | **28%** | **0.06** |
| **Our Fusion (θ=0.90)** | Safety-critical threshold | **3%** | **47%** | **0.02** |

### 4.6 Two-Tier Deployment Strategy

```
Tier 1 (θ = 0.70):
  - Attempt automatic generation
  - Success rate: 72% (100% - 28% AR)
  - Error rate: 6%

Tier 2 (θ = 0.95) for Tier 1 failures:
  - Re-attempt with stricter threshold on Tier 1 abstentions
  - Additional success: 15% (of original 28%)
  - Error rate on Tier 2: <1%

Human Review:
  - Remaining: 13% (abstained at both tiers)

Overall Results:
  - Automation: 87% (72% + 15%)
  - Error rate: <1% (weighted average)
  - Human review: 13%

This strategy achieves high automation (87%) with safety-critical error rate (<1%).

## 5. Statistical Testing and Significance

### 5.1 Hypothesis Testing

**5.1.1 Primary Hypothesis**

```
H0 (Null): Hybrid approach performance = Pure LLM performance
H1 (Alternative): Hybrid approach performance > Pure LLM performance

Test: One-tailed paired t-test (same problems, different systems)
Significance level: α = 0.05
Statistical power: 1 - β ≥ 0.80
```

**5.1.2 Effect Size**

```
Cohen's d = (Mean_hybrid - Mean_LLM) / SD_pooled

Interpretation:
- Small effect: d ≈ 0.2
- Medium effect: d ≈ 0.5
- Large effect: d ≈ 0.8

Expected: d ≥ 0.8 for Level 3 (temporal calculation)
```

**5.1.3 Confidence Intervals**

```
Report 95% CI for all primary metrics:

Example: Temporal Calculation EM
- Pure LLM: 14% (95% CI: [12%, 16%])
- Hybrid: 88% (95% CI: [86%, 90%])

Non-overlapping CIs → statistically significant difference
```

### 5.2 Multiple Comparisons Correction

**5.2.1 Bonferroni Correction**

```
For k comparisons, adjusted significance level:
α_adjusted = α / k

Example: 5 levels × 3 metrics = 15 comparisons
α_adjusted = 0.05 / 15 ≈ 0.003

More conservative but guards against Type I error (false positives)
```

**5.2.2 False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control**

```
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure:
1. Rank p-values: p(1) ≤ p(2) ≤ ... ≤ p(m)
2. Find largest i where p(i) ≤ (i/m) * α
3. Reject H0 for all i ≤ i_max

Less conservative than Bonferroni, controls FDR at level α
```

### 5.3 Cross-Validation and Bootstrapping

**5.3.1 K-Fold Cross-Validation (K=5)**

```
For fine-tuning experiments:
1. Partition dataset into 5 folds
2. Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold
3. Repeat 5 times (different test fold each time)
4. Report mean and standard deviation across folds

Ensures generalization beyond single train/test split
```

**5.3.2 Bootstrap Resampling (B=1000)**

```
For user study metrics:
1. Resample participants with replacement (B times)
2. Compute metric for each bootstrap sample
3. Construct 95% CI from bootstrap distribution

Handles small sample sizes (N=45 participants)
```

### 5.4 Interrater Reliability (Dataset Annotation)

**5.4.1 Cohen's Kappa (κ)**

```
κ = (P_observed - P_expected) / (1 - P_expected)

Interpretation:
- κ < 0.20: Slight agreement
- κ = 0.21-0.40: Fair agreement
- κ = 0.41-0.60: Moderate agreement
- κ = 0.61-0.80: Substantial agreement
- κ > 0.80: Almost perfect agreement

Requirement: κ ≥ 0.85 for dataset annotation
```

**5.4.2 Fleiss' Kappa (Multiple Raters)**

```
For 3+ annotators on temporal entity extraction:
Fleiss_κ = (P̄ - P̄e) / (1 - P̄e)

Where P̄ = mean pairwise agreement across all raters
```

## 6. Efficiency and Scalability Metrics

### 6.1 Computational Efficiency

**6.1.1 Inference Time**

```
Inference_Time = mean(time per problem)

Breakdown:
- LLM generation time
- Symbolic reasoning time
- Total end-to-end time

Target: <5 seconds per problem (median complexity)
```

**6.1.2 Throughput**

```
Throughput = problems per second

Measured under different loads:
- Single-threaded
- Parallel (batch processing)

Target: ≥1 problem/second (median complexity, single-threaded)
```

**6.1.3 Memory Usage**

```
Memory_Usage = peak memory consumption (GB)

Components:
- LLM model size (e.g., 8GB for Llama 3.1 8B)
- Symbolic solver memory
- Provenance storage

Target: ≤16GB (consumer-grade hardware)
```

### 6.2 Scalability Metrics

**6.2.1 Time Complexity**

```
Measure time vs problem complexity (# entities, # constraints)

Expected:
- LLM: O(n) where n = input length
- Allen's IA: O(n^3) for path consistency (n = # intervals)
- STN: O(n^3) for Floyd-Warshall (n = # events)

Tractability limit: n ≤ 100 events for real-time response
```

**6.2.2 Space Complexity**

```
Measure memory vs provenance polynomial size

Expected:
- Polynomial size: Exponential in derivation depth (worst case)
- Compression: Factorization reduces to polynomial in practice

Tractability limit: Provenance graphs with ≤10^6 nodes
```

### 6.3 Cost Metrics

**6.3.1 API Costs (Commercial LLMs)**

```
API_Cost = (# tokens × cost per token)

Example (GPT-4):
- Input: $0.03 per 1K tokens
- Output: $0.06 per 1K tokens
- Average problem: 500 input + 200 output tokens
- Cost per problem: $0.027

For 5000-problem benchmark: ~$135
```

**6.3.2 Training Costs (Fine-Tuning)**

```
Training_Cost = (GPU hours × cost per hour)

Example (QLoRA on 3× RTX A6000):
- Cloud rental: $2-3 per GPU-hour
- Training time: 40-60 hours
- Total cost: $240-540

One-time cost, amortized across inference
```

**6.3.3 Human Annotation Costs**

```
Annotation_Cost = (hours × hourly rate)

Example (dataset construction):
- Temporal benchmark: 500 expert hours × $50-100/hour = $25K-50K
- User study: 45 participants × $75 average = $3,375

Total: $28K-53K (one-time, dataset released publicly)
```
