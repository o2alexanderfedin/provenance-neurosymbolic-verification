# Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning Prototype

A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture for temporal reasoning, combining LLM-based extraction with symbolic Allen's Interval Algebra reasoning.

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates how combining neural (LLM) and symbolic (Allen's Interval Algebra) approaches can improve temporal reasoning accuracy, verifiability, and explainability compared to pure LLM approaches.

### Key Features

- **Three-Level Temporal Reasoning**:
  - Level 1: Event extraction from natural language
  - Level 2: Temporal ordering and relationship inference
  - Level 3: Duration calculations and temporal arithmetic

- **Allen's Interval Algebra**: Implementation of all 13 basic temporal relations with constraint propagation

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Seamless integration of LLM extraction and symbolic verification

- **Provenance Tracking**: Complete reasoning chain tracking for transparent explanations

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 20 test cases covering medical, financial, project management, and other domains

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the prototype directory
cd ./prototype/

# Optional: Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# No package installation needed - all dependencies are in standard library
```

## Quick Start

### Running Individual Components

### Running Test Cases

```bash
# View test suite summary
python test_cases.py

# Run comprehensive evaluation
python run_experiments.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Temporal Reasoning

```python
from hybrid_reasoner import HybridTemporalReasoner

# Initialize reasoner
reasoner = HybridTemporalReasoner(llm_accuracy="medium")

# Ask a temporal question
question = "Patient was admitted Monday, had surgery Tuesday, discharged Friday. How long was the stay?"

# Get hybrid reasoning result
result = reasoner.reason(question)

print(f"Answer: {result.verified_answer}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
print(f"Used Symbolic Verification: {result.used_symbolic}")
```

### Example 2: Comparing Hybrid vs Pure LLM

```python
from hybrid_reasoner import HybridTemporalReasoner

reasoner = HybridTemporalReasoner()

question = "Meeting lasted 2 hours, 30 min break, 1 hour workshop. Total time?"

# Get comparison
comparison = reasoner.compare_with_pure_llm(question)

print(f"Pure LLM: {comparison['pure_llm_answer']}")
print(f"Hybrid: {comparison['hybrid_answer']}")
print(f"Improvement: {comparison['improvement']}")
```

### Example 3: Accessing Provenance

```python
from hybrid_reasoner import HybridTemporalReasoner

reasoner = HybridTemporalReasoner()
result = reasoner.reason("What events occurred?")

# Get detailed explanation
explanation = reasoner.provenance.generate_explanation(result.provenance_id)
print(explanation)

# Get confidence breakdown
confidence = reasoner.provenance.get_confidence_score(result.provenance_id)
print(f"Overall confidence: {confidence:.2f}")
```

2. Compare hybrid vs pure LLM approaches
3. Generate accuracy metrics
4. Produce detailed results report
5. Show example provenance traces

## Key Results Demonstrated

The prototype demonstrates:

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Symbolic verification catches LLM errors in arithmetic and ordering

3. **Explainability**: Human-readable explanations of reasoning steps

4. **Error Detection**: Identifies inconsistencies in LLM extractions

5. **Confidence Calibration**: Provides well-calibrated confidence scores

## Limitations

This is a proof-of-concept prototype with intentional limitations:

- Mock LLM (not integrated with real LLM APIs)
- Simplified Allen's Algebra composition table
- Basic constraint solver (not full CSP)
- Limited time parsing capabilities
- No learning/adaptation mechanisms

For production use, you would need:
- Real LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Full Allen's Algebra implementation
- Advanced CSP solver (Z3, python-constraint)
- Robust NLP for time extraction
- Training data for error patterns

## Extension Ideas

1. **Real LLM Integration**: Connect to GPT-4, Claude, or other LLMs

2. **Advanced Solvers**: Integrate Z3 or other SMT solvers

3. **Learning Component**: Learn from corrections to improve extraction

4. **Broader Coverage**: Extend to other reasoning domains (spatial, causal)

5. **Interactive Mode**: Allow users to correct and refine extractions

6. **Visualization**: Add graphical timeline visualization

7. **Benchmarking**: Evaluate on established temporal reasoning benchmarks
