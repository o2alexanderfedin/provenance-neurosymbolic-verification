# Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning Prototype
# Requirements file for Python dependencies

# Core Python version: 3.8+

# No external dependencies required for basic functionality
# The prototype is designed to be self-contained for demonstration purposes

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:

# For constraint solving (if extending beyond prototype):
# python-constraint==1.4.0
# z3-solver==4.12.2.0

# For data handling:
# numpy>=1.21.0
# pandas>=1.3.0

# For visualization (optional):
# matplotlib>=3.4.0
# networkx>=2.6.0

# For testing:
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=3.0.0

# For development:
# black>=22.0.0
# flake8>=4.0.0
# mypy>=0.950

# Note: The current implementation uses only Python standard library
# to ensure maximum portability and minimal setup requirements.
# All core functionality works without additional installations.
