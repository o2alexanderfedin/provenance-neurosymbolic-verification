## Diagram 2: Temporal Reasoning Architecture (Main Paper - Figure 2)

### Description

**Purpose**: Detailed view of the temporal reasoning module showing integration with main system.

**Layout**: Horizontal flow with parallel tracks (inspired by TReMu dual-track approach)

**Components** (left to right):

1. **Input: Natural Language with Temporal Content**
   - Example: "Patient admitted at 10:00 AM. Blood culture must be obtained within 3 hours. Antibiotics within 1 hour of culture. Lab results in 24-48 hours. Antibiotic adjustment within 4 hours of results."
   - Visual: Rounded rectangle, light blue

2. **LLM Temporal Extraction (Track 1)**
   - Entity Recognition:
     * Events: {admission, blood_culture, antibiotics, lab_results, adjustment}
     * Times: {10:00 AM, +3h, +1h, +24-48h, +4h}
   - Constraint Extraction:
     * Qualitative: blood_culture BEFORE antibiotics
     * Quantitative: blood_culture ≤ admission + 3h
   - Visual: Rectangle, orange background
   - Output: Temporal facts + constraints (structured JSON)

3. **Allen's Interval Algebra Reasoner (Track 2A)**
   - Input: Qualitative temporal relations

     * Provenance polynomial construction
   - Output: Temporal provenance polynomial Π_temporal
   - Visual: Rectangle, teal background (middle parallel track)

6. **Integration & Consistency Check**
   - Merge qualitative (Allen's IA) and quantitative (STN) results
   - Cross-validation: Do qualitative and quantitative agree?
   - Conflict resolution: If disagreement, symbolic takes priority, flag for review
   - Visual: Diamond decision node + merge box, yellow

7. **Output: Complete Temporal Solution**
   - Timeline with all event times
   - Temporal relations explicitly stated
   - Provenance tracking (dependency graph)

**Visual Features**:
- Parallel tracks (2A, 2B, 2C) shown side-by-side with synchronization point at Integration
- Timeline visualization at bottom showing events on temporal axis
- Provenance dependencies shown as arrows between events

**Example Timeline Visualization** (embedded in diagram):
```
Time Axis: 10:00 -------- 13:00 - 14:00 ------- 34:00-58:00 ---- 38:00-62:00
Events:    admission   blood_culture  antibiotics  lab_results  adjustment
           t=0         t≤3h          t≤4h         t=24-48h     t=28-52h or 52-66h

Provenance Dependencies (arrows):
admission → blood_culture (3h deadline)
blood_culture → antibiotics (1h deadline)
blood_culture → lab_results (24-48h wait)
lab_results → adjustment (4h deadline)
```

### Description

**Purpose**: Show the iterative refinement process using provenance feedback.

**Layout**: Circular flow with iteration loop

**Components**:

1. **Input**
   - Natural language problem P
   - Positive examples E+ (desired outputs)
   - Negative examples E- (prohibited outputs)
   - Target DSL
   - Visual: Rounded rectangle, light blue

2. **Initial LLM Generation (Iteration 0)**

   - For each e+ ∈ E+: why-provenance (derivation path)
   - For each e- ∈ E-: why-not-provenance (blocking reason)
   - Visual: Rectangle, teal
   - Output: Provenance feedback

5. **Why-Provenance Analysis**
   - For e+ not derived (Π(e+) = 0):
     * Extract missing predicates/rules
     * Generate constraint: "Must derive e+"
   - Visual: Decision diamond + box, yellow
   - Output: Positive constraints

6. **Why-Not-Provenance Analysis**
   - For e- incorrectly derived (Π(e-) ≠ 0):
     * Extract spurious derivation path
     * Generate constraint: "Must not derive e-"
   - Visual: Decision diamond + box, red
   - Output: Negative constraints

7. **Refinement (Iteration i+1)**
   - Combine positive and negative constraints
   - Provide structured feedback to LLM
   - LLM generates D_{i+1}
   - Visual: Rectangle, orange (same as step 2)
   - Output: D_{i+1}

8. **Convergence Check**
   - All E+ derived correctly? AND
   - All E- NOT derived? AND
   - Iteration count < max (3)?
   - Visual: Diamond decision node, green
   - If YES → Output Final Program
   - If NO → Return to step 3 (Symbolic Execution)

9. **Semantic Reversion Check (Logic-LM++ Strategy)**
   - Is D_{i+1} better than D_i?
   - If NO: Revert to D_i
   - If YES: Accept D_{i+1}

**Example Annotations** (concrete example in diagram):
- Problem: "Find all employees earning more than their manager"
- E+: {employee(alice, 120000), manager(bob, 100000)} → should derive employee(alice)
- E-: {employee(charlie, 80000), manager(bob, 100000)} → should NOT derive employee(charlie)
- Iteration 0: Wrong comparison (< instead of >)
- Provenance feedback: "e- incorrectly derived via rule with '<', should use '>'"
- Iteration 1: Corrected comparison, all tests pass

### Mermaid Conversion Notes

```
- Use `graph TD` with explicit loop arrows
- Color code by component type (LLM=orange, symbolic=purple, provenance=teal)

**Layout**: Vertical flow with parallel uncertainty signals merging into decision gate

**Components**:

1. **Input: Natural Language Problem**
   - Visual: Rounded rectangle, light blue

2. **LLM Generation**
   - Generate DSL program D
   - Visual: Rectangle, orange
   - Output: DSL program D

3. **Uncertainty Signal 1: LLM Confidence**

   - Aggregate: conf = exp(mean(log_prob_i))
   - Visual: Rectangle, yellow (left parallel track)
   - Output: conf ∈ [0, 1]

4. **Uncertainty Signal 2: Multi-Sample Agreement**
   - Generate N=5 independent samples
   - Compare: agree = (# samples matching D) / N
   - Visual: Rectangle, yellow (middle parallel track)
   - Output: agree ∈ [0, 1]

5. **Uncertainty Signal 3: Parse-and-Regenerate**
   - D → NL description → D' (regenerate)

     * Problem statement
     * Attempted DSL D
     * Uncertainty breakdown (conf, agree, consistent)
     * Uncertainty score U and threshold θ
     * Reason for abstention (which signal triggered)

- Performance table inset:
  | θ    | AR   | FNR  | P(error) | Domain          |
  |------|------|------|----------|-----------------|
  | 0.70 | 28%  | 8%   | 6%       | General         |
  | 0.90 | 47%  | 3%   | 2%       | Medical         |
  | 0.95 | 63%  | 1%   | 0.6%     | Aerospace       |

**Probabilistic Guarantee Box** (annotation):
```
P(error) ≤ P(LLM_error | U ≤ θ) × (1 - AR) + P(symbolic_error)
          ≈ FNR × (1 - AR) + 0  (symbolic verified)
```

### Mermaid Conversion Notes

```
- Use `flowchart TD`
- Parallel subgraphs for uncertainty signals (1, 2, 3)
- Decision diamond with conditional styling (color based on threshold)

## Diagram 6: Temporal Provenance Example (Case Study Visualization)

### Description

**Purpose**: Concrete example of temporal provenance tracking in healthcare scenario.

**Layout**: Timeline with provenance dependencies

**Scenario**: Sepsis Treatment Protocol

**Timeline (Horizontal Axis)**:
```
Time (hours from admission):
0h    3h    4h    24h   48h   52h   66h
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
A     B     C           D     E     F
```

**Events**:
- **A (t=0h)**: Patient admission (suspected sepsis)
- **B (t≤3h)**: Blood culture obtained (constraint: within 3h of A)
- **C (t≤4h)**: Antibiotics administered (constraint: within 1h of B)
- **D (t=24-48h)**: Lab results available (constraint: 24-48h after B)
- **E (t≤52h)**: Antibiotic adjustment (constraint: within 4h of D, if D at 48h)
- **F (t≤20h)**: ICU escalation decision (constraint: if no improvement within 6h of C)

**Provenance Dependencies (Arrows)**:
- A → B: "Blood culture deadline depends on admission time" [3h constraint]
- B → C: "Antibiotic deadline depends on blood culture time" [1h constraint]
- B → D: "Lab results depend on blood culture" [24-48h wait]
- D → E: "Adjustment deadline depends on lab results" [4h constraint]
- C → F: "ICU decision depends on antibiotic administration" [6h window]

**Provenance Polynomial (Annotated)**:
```
Π_E = temporal_composition(Π_A, 3h, 1h, [24-48h], 4h)
    = A ⊕ (A ⊗ 3h) ⊕ ((A ⊗ 3h) ⊗ 1h) ⊕ ... ⊕ E

Interpretation:
- Event E (antibiotic adjustment) time depends on cascade:
  A (admission) → B (culture, +3h) → D (results, +24-48h) → E (adjustment, +4h)
- Total time range: 28-52h or 52-66h depending on lab result timing
```

**Counterfactual Query (Visualization)**:
- **Query**: "If blood culture delayed by 1 hour (to t=4h instead of t=3h), how are downstream events affected?"
- **Counterfactual Timeline**:
  ```
  Original: A(0) → B(3) → C(4) → D(27-51) → E(31-55)
  Modified: A(0) → B(4) → C(5) → D(28-52) → E(32-56)

  Cascade: All downstream events shift by +1 hour
  Critical path: Still on schedule (no violations)
  ```

**Visual Features**:
- Color-coded events: Green (on time), Yellow (near deadline), Red (violated)
- Dashed arrows: Provenance dependencies
- Solid arrows: Timeline sequence
- Boxes with constraints labeled on arrows
- Provenance polynomial displayed in math notation

**Explanation Text Box** (in diagram):
```
"Why was antibiotic adjustment at 52h after admission?"

Provenance Explanation:
1. Blood culture obtained at t=3h (within 3h deadline ✓)
2. Antibiotics administered at t=4h (within 1h of culture ✓)
3. Lab results available at t=48h (at maximum 48h window ⚠)
4. Antibiotic adjustment at t=52h (within 4h of results ✓)

Critical dependency: Lab result timing (48h) determined adjustment timing.
If lab results available earlier (e.g., 24h), adjustment would be at 28h.
```

### Mermaid Conversion Notes

```
- Use `gantt` chart or custom timeline
- Arrows with labels (Mermaid doesn't support this well, may need manual annotation)
- Color-coded events
- Embedded text boxes for explanation
```

   - Adjust to target distribution:
     * Easy: 30% (baseline success rate >70%)
     * Medium: 50% (baseline success rate 40-70%)
     * Hard: 20% (baseline success rate <40%)
   - Visual: Rectangle, blue
   - Output: Calibrated difficulty labels

7. **Quality Control**
   - Cross-domain validation (same pattern in multiple domains)
   - Adversarial examples (edge cases, ambiguities)
   - Balanced representation (domain, difficulty, level)
   - Visual: Rectangle, green
   - Output: Final validated dataset

8. **Dataset Release**
   - GitHub repository
   - JSON format with all annotations
   - Evaluation scripts
   - Baseline results

## Conversion Instructions

### For Mermaid Rendering:

1. **Flowcharts**: Use `flowchart TD` or `flowchart LR`
2. **Styling**: Define CSS classes for component types
3. **Subgraphs**: Group related components
4. **Decision Nodes**: Use diamond shape `{text}`
5. **Annotations**: Use note/comment syntax

### For Complex Visualizations (not natively supported in Mermaid):

1. **Radar Charts**: Use Python (matplotlib) or JavaScript (D3.js)
2. **Heatmaps**: Use Python (seaborn) or R (ggplot2)
3. **Waterfall Charts**: Use Plotly or custom D3.js
