**Total Dataset Size**: 5,000 problems (1,000 per level)
**Domains**: Healthcare (35%), Finance (25%), Aerospace (20%), Legal (15%), Robotics (5%)
**Ground Truth**: Expert-annotated with formal temporal constraint specifications
**Public Release**: GitHub repository with evaluation scripts and leaderboard
